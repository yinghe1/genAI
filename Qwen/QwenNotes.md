Tried https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code using local ollama model and create simple pdf-chat application

Here is the starting prompt:
can you create a node.js project under current dir called pdf-chat using microservice framework lit.dev for UI which I can later embed into larger angular framework project? you can create 1 page with a button called "Summerize the pdf" using a static prompt template for now, and another UI textarea for user to ask question about the pdf and be able to display the results of the answer of the question. In the backend, for both summerize and asking questions and answer, please use chat ollama with local ollama and langchain framework invoking ollama model. For the pdf, just create a folder called data and I will provide a sample.pdf later when the code is created.

# Claude code and Qwen comparision for quick prototyping
- using Claude code cost $5 complete in 40min, user experience is better
- using Qwen cost free since 2000 free request per day, complete in 1hr and more question and debug. Not as good as Claude but close and free
